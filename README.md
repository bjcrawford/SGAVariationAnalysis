An Analysis of Variation Methods used in Genetic Algorithms
===========================================================

This program was created as a part of an independent research course on 
Evolutionary Computation taken in the spring of 2015. The inspiration for this 
program is from the text "Introduction to Evolutionary Algorithms" by Xinjie Yu.

The implementation and parameters of the genetic algorithms used are as follows:

Upon initialization, a population of 20 individuals is uniformly generated 
across the search space described by the test function. The GA has a limit of 
20 generations. With each generation, a mating pool is populated using a 
roulette wheel selection. This method uses the relative fitness values to 
determine the size of each individual's "slice" of the roulette wheel. 
Selection is done with replacement, meaning an individual can be selected 
from the population into the mating pool multiple times. 

Once the mating pool has been populated, the reproduce method mates adjacent 
individuals within the mating pool list (i.e., 0 and 1, 2 and 3, etcâ€¦). After 
performing the crossover operation, each child individual undergoes the 
mutation operation. The probability for crossover has been set at 0.8 and 
the probability of mutation, at the gene level for the binary representations 
and at the variable level for the continuous representations, has been set at 
0.01. Each run (i.e., a test using a particular representation, test function, 
and variation method), consists of 100 independent trials. For each run the 
best and worst individuals are recorded as well as the mean objective values 
produced.

This simple genetic algorithm is used to attempt to find a solution to the 
following optimization problems:

### Function 1

A simple sinusoidal function with many local minima and maxima. This is
a maximum problem with a global maxima at f(1.85) = 3.85.

max f(x) = x * sin(10 * pi * x) + 2.0, 

s.t. -1 < x < 2

Dimensions: 1

The curve of the above objective function is shown below:

### Function 2

The sphere model function (De Jong's Function 1) is convex, continuous,
and unimodal. This is a minimum problem with a global minimum at 
f(0) = 0.0.
 
min f(x) = sum(xi^2), 
 
s.t. -5 < x < 5

Dimensions: 5

### Function 3

The Ackley function offers many local minima on the outer edges
with a deep global minima located at the center. This is a minimum 
problem with a global minimum at f(0) = 0.0.
 
min f(x) = -20 * exp(-0.2 * sqrt(1/n * sum(xi^2)) - exp(1/n * sum(cos(2 * pi * xi))) + 20 + e, 
            
s.t. -20 < x < 30
 
Dimensions: 2
